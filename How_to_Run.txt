Please first note that I had to split preprocess, hyperparameters, and the model files into their own object and scene files.
This is just due to the way they had run.py structured before and fitting it into that code. 

There are 3 options to run the code, split up into respective tasks:
1 - Runs the scene model
2 - Runs the Object Model
3 - (Yet to be implemented) Runs both models

In order to run the scene classification model enter the following into the terminal: 

python run.py --task 1 --data ../data/15_Scene - FOR OUR OWN MODEL

python run.py --task 3 --data ../data/15_Scene - FOR VGG MODEL


To run the object classification model enter the following: 

python run.py --task 2 --data ../data/CIFAR-100-modified - FOR OWN MODEL

python run.py --task 4 --data ../data/CIFAR-100-modified - FOR VGG MODEL

The same logic follows for task 5 being both models. However we should discuss how we want to implement this a little more in depth.

Finally, most of the commands are same as with HW5 minus the LIME implementation. 
Let me know if you have any questions!
